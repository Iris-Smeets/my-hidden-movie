    Like many people i also really love watching movies and tv-shows on my computer or tv. My favorite position is when Iâ€™m on the coach with a blanket and with fuzzy socks. And then I am al sett for a tv-marathon. Looking for the best shows on Netflix? Look no further, because i have put together a list of the best original Netflix series available to watch right now:
    How to get away with murder, Gilmore Girls, One day at a time, The blacklist en The ridder.
    There are more very good shows but unfortunately they are no longer on netflix so i did not include them in this list.</p>
